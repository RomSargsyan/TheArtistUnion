            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>We promise to listen to every submission.</li>
              <li>We decide which tracks get featured for promotion.</li>
              <li>
                Due to the volume of submissions, we have to charge so
                that we can listen to every track.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we don't promote your track on the platform of your
                choice we will provide detailed feedback on how to improve the track.
              </li>
              <li>
                Since we spend time listening to every submission and provide feedback there will be
                <strong>no refunds</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sets will be <strong>ignored</strong>
                â€”only 1 track per submission please.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you choose the new <strong>double promotion</strong>
                package, make sure that the SoundCloud and Spotify links are for the same song.
