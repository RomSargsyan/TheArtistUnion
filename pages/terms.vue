            California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
          </p>
          <h4>Agreement to Arbitrate</h4>
          <p>
            You and The Artist Union agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
            relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
            validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will
            be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to
            bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other
            equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
            infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
            secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the
            foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue
            of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern
            District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to
            jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and The Artist
            Union are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or
            class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless
            both you and The Artist Union otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not
            consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form
            of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held
            unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.
            Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive
            any termination of these Terms.
          </p>
          <h4>Arbitration Rules</h4>
          <p>
            The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in
            accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for
            Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this
            “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or
            by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
            interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
          </p>
          <h4>Arbitration Process</h4>
          <p>
            A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written
            Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand
            for Arbitration (
            <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/services/fileacase/forms" target="_blank">URL</a>
            ). The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law
            and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties
            are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand
            for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA
            Rules.
          </p>
          <h4>Arbitration Location and Procedure</h4>
          <p>
            Unless you and The Artist Union otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in
            the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration
            will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and The Artist Union
            submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that
            a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be
            determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the
            discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent
            with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
          </p>
          <h4>Arbitrator’s Decision</h4>
          <p>
            The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
            The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which
            the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any
            court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent
            with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts
            of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
            injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to
            provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in
            arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the
            extent provided under applicable law. The Artist Union will not seek, and hereby waives
            all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if
            it prevails in arbitration.
          </p>
          <h4>Fees</h4>
          <p>
            Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely
            as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000,
            The Artist Union will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance
            of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was
            brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of
            Civil Procedure 11(b)).
          </p>
          <h4>Changes</h4>
          <p>
            Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if The Artist Union changes this “Dispute Resolution”
            section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes
            to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by
            email to info@The Artist Union.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective,
            as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of The Artist Union’s email to
            you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will
            arbitrate any Dispute between you and The Artist Union in accordance with the provisions of
            this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted
            any subsequent changes to these Terms).
          </p>
          <h4>General Terms</h4>
          <p>
            These Terms and any additional terms for Paid Premium Features (the “Additional Terms”)
            constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between The Artist Union
            and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and
            all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between The Artist Union and you
            regarding the Services and Content.
          </p>
          <p>
            If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms
            invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
            and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without The
            Artist Union’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms,
            without such consent, will be null. The Artist Union may freely assign or transfer these
            Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the
            benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any notices or other communications provided by The Artist Union under these Terms,
            including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email;
            or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will
            be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Artist Union’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
            considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision
            will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of The
            Artist Union. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of
            any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under
            these Terms or otherwise.
