          <h3>Who we are</h3>
          <p>
            Growth is the most important thing for today's new artists.
            With an active fanbase, artists can monetize and provide a living
            for themselves in new and creative ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that talent no longer needs to depend on traditional music labels,
            marketing engines that serve their own needs first.
            We've helped and witnessed artists grow from being a bedroom DJ to touring
            worldwide and having a massive fanbase, without ever needing a music label.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are entrepreneurs, engineers, artists, and most importantly, music lovers.
            We're committed to helping you find your most dedicated fans, and giving them a
            beautiful music experience.
